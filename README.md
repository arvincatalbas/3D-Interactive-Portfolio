# 3D Interactive Portfolio 🚀

An immersive, premium 3D developer portfolio website built using React, Three.js, and React Three Fiber (R3F). The portfolio places the visitor inside an interactive 3D developer room/workspace where they can interact with physical objects to explore projects, credentials, resume, and real-time GitHub activity.

---

## 🎨 Design & Theme

- **Aesthetic**: Premium dark-mode workspace using soft lighting, neon accent glows, and responsive glassmorphism overlays.
- **Interactivity**: Clicking on 3D objects in the room seamlessly zooms the camera to focus on them while fading in rich 2D UI panels.
- **Micro-animations**: Smooth hover transitions, floating 3D elements, and physics-based particle effects.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework**: React 19 + Vite 6
- **3D Library**: Three.js
- **React 3D Renderer**: React Three Fiber (R3F)
- **3D Helpers**: `@react-three/drei`
- **Animations**: `framer-motion` (2D overlays) and `maath` / GSAP (3D Camera Lerp)
- **Icons**: `lucide-react`
- **Styling**: Vanilla CSS (Custom properties & modern flex/grid layouts)

## 📂 Project Folder Structure

This project follows a component-driven routing architecture where each route dynamically changes the 3D canvas viewport and mounts a dedicated 2D overlay component:

## 📦 Dependencies

Here are the key packages required for the project:

### Production Dependencies (`dependencies`):
- `three`: Core 3D engine library.
- `@react-three/fiber`: React wrapper for Three.js.
- `@react-three/drei`: Useful helpers, controls, and components (e.g. `<Html>`, `<PerspectiveCamera>`).
- `@react-three/postprocessing`: Advanced post-processing effects (glows, ambient occlusion).
- `react-router-dom`: Manages URL routing linked to camera look-at nodes.
- `framer-motion`: Smooth spring animations for 2D overlays and modals.
- `lucide-react`: Modern SVG vector icons.
- `canvas-confetti`: Triggered during certificate unlocks/resume viewing.

### Development Dependencies (`devDependencies`):
- `vite`: Build tool and dev server.
- `@types/three`: Type definitions for Three.js.
- `@types/canvas-confetti`: Type definitions for Confetti.

## 📸 Core Features Implementation Plan

1. **3D Room Scene**: Created using custom geometries (desk, laptop, monitors, bookshelf, plants) stylized with metallic, matte, and emission shaders.
2. **Interactive Laptop Screen**: Utilizes `@react-three/drei`'s `<Html transform>` component to render a scrollable, responsive HTML projects list directly onto the laptop monitor mesh.
3. **Wall Certificate Gallery**: Picture frames mapped with certificate textures that expand to full screen using Framer Motion when clicked.
4. **Holographic Github Terminal**: A glowing console terminal styled like CRT monitors that executes mock queries and displays GitHub repositories and contribution counts using Fetch API.
5. **Route-Based Camera Transitions**: The `useCameraMover` hook reads the active location from `react-router-dom` and triggers a smooth linear interpolation (Lerp) to slide and rotate the camera towards the targeted interactive objects.
